Project Insights: Student Enrollment & Performance Analysis
Top Revenue Department: The "General Stu Medicine" department generates the highest total tuition revenue. It is the most financially significant department for the institution.

Academic Excellence: Postgraduate and PhD students maintain a higher average final grade (above 75%) compared to Undergraduate students. This suggests higher academic performance in advanced levels.

Peak Enrollment Season: The majority of student enrollments happen during the "Autumn" semester. This indicates that the start of the academic year is the busiest period for admissions.

Credit Cost Analysis: The "Engineering" and "Medicine" departments have the highest "Fee Per Credit." This shows that technical and medical courses are more expensive to provide than Arts or Sciences.

Student Volume vs. Revenue: While the "Arts and Humanities" faculty has a high number of students, their total tuition contribution is lower than that of the Medicine department due to lower individual fees.
